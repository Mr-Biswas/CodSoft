Online 4 weeks Virtual Internship on Python [1Aug-31Aug]
During my virtual internship, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of hands-on projects and wrote around 500 lines of code , which allowed me to apply and enhance my programming skills in Python. Below are the key projects I worked on, along with the specific skills I gained:

1. Calculator Application (Basic Operations)
Description: The first project I worked on was a simple command-line calculator application. The program allowed users to input two numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it had an option for the user to exit the program.

Skills Learned:
User Input Handling: I gained experience in handling user inputs and validating the input to ensure the program worked correctly.
Control Flow: I worked with loops (while loop) and conditionals (if, elif, else) to implement the core functionality of the program.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: I understood how to use basic arithmetic operators in Python to perform calculations.

2. Password Generator
Description: In this project, I created a password generator application that generates a strong password based on the user's input. The user specifies the number of letters, numbers, and special characters they want in the password, and the program generates a random, secure password.

Skills Learned:
Randomization: I learned how to use Python’s random module to generate random characters and numbers, which is essential for creating secure passwords.
String Manipulation: I worked with lists and strings to concatenate different types of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) into a password.
User Interaction: I improved my ability to collect multiple user inputs and provide customized results based on those inputs.

3. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Description: This project involved creating a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, where the user plays against the computer. The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the winner is determined based on the game’s rules.

Skills Learned:
Random Selection: I learned how to generate random choices for the computer using random.choice().
Game Logic: I implemented the game’s rules using conditionals to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.
Input Validation: I made sure to handle invalid user inputs and provided feedback to the user to keep the game smooth.

4. To-Do List Application
Description: I built a simple To-Do list application where the user can add, update, delete, and view tasks. This project involved using lists and loops to manage tasks and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Skills Learned:
Data Structure (List): I used Python lists to store and manipulate tasks.
CRUD Operations: I gained hands-on experience implementing basic CRUD functionalities in a real-world context.
User Interface: Although it was a command-line application, I learned how to design a user-friendly interface with simple prompts and instructions.

5. Quiz Game
Description: This project involved creating a multiple-choice quiz game about general knowledge. The user is presented with questions, and they need to select the correct answer. After the quiz, the program provides the score based on the correct answers.

Skills Learned:
Data Representation: I learned how to represent data (questions, answers, and options) in dictionaries and lists.
User Interaction: The project required good interaction with the user, including presenting multiple-choice questions and handling user input.
Feedback Mechanism: I implemented real-time feedback on whether the user’s answer was correct or incorrect, and calculated the score at the end.

6. Math Quiz Game (Math Problems Generator)
Description: This project involved creating a math quiz where random math problems are generated for the user to solve. The program calculates how long it takes the user to complete the problems, tracks the number of incorrect answers, and shows the total time taken at the end.

Skills Learned:
Random Number Generation: I became proficient in generating random numbers to create different math problems for the quiz.
Timer Functionality: I learned how to use Python’s time module to measure how long the user takes to answer each question.
Input Validation: I made sure that the program handled user input effectively and provided feedback when answers were incorrect.

7. Typing Speed Checker
Description: This project is a typing speed game where the user is shown a sentence to type, and the program measures the speed (in words per second) and accuracy (number of mistakes) based on the user’s input.

Skills Learned:
String Manipulation and Comparison: I worked with strings to compare the user's typed input with the original sentence and calculate errors.
Timing Functions: I gained experience with Python’s time module to track the time taken by the user to type the sentence.
Calculation of Speed and Accuracy: I implemented logic to calculate the typing speed and errors, which helped me understand how performance metrics can be derived from user input.

8. Cafe Management System

Skills Learned:
Working with Dictionaries: This project demonstrates how to use dictionaries to store key-value pairs (in this case, items and their prices). It shows how to efficiently retrieve item prices using the item's name as the key.
User Input and Validation: The program takes user input using the input() function, and checks if the input exists in the dictionary (if item1 in menu:). This is a common method to validate input and ensure that only valid items can be added to the order.
String Manipulation: The .title() method is used to format the input strings, ensuring that the first letter of each word is capitalized. This allows the program to handle user input in a case-insensitive manner.
Control Flow(Conditionals & Loops): The while loop ensures that the customer can continuously order items until they decide to stop. The if -elif -else statements are used to check user responses and validate orders.
Accumulating Total Prices: The program accumulates the total price of items ordered using the order_total variable. This shows how to work with variables and update them based on conditions.
Handling Invalid Inputs: If an invalid item is entered(one that isn't in the menu), the program informs the user, which is a simple form of error handling and input validation.
Capitalization and String Methods: The capitalize() and title() methods in Python are used for normalizing user input, which helps in ensuring that different variations in case (like lowercase or uppercase input) don't break the program.
